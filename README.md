# AnonMeProxy

**AnonMeProxy** is an intuitive tool programmed in Bash that uses Proxychains to automatically anonymize all network connections. 

**AnonMeProxy** has just started with version **1.0**. This initial version includes basic functionalities such as checks and automatic updates. 

I am working on enhanced versions that will add new features to improve anonymization and overall usability. I will also develop a version in Python with a graphical interface (GUI).
